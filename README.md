# 🎬 Pandas Movies Dataset Exploratory Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Movies dataset using **Pandas**. The goal is to discover meaningful insights, trends, and patterns to better understand film characteristics and performance metrics.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas** – For data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration
- **Matplotlib** – For creating visualizations

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset typically contains the following columns (may vary slightly depending on the source):

- **Title** – Name of the movie
- **Genre** – Genre or categories of the movie
- **Director** – Director of the movie
- **Actors** – Main cast
- **Year** – Release year
- **Runtime** – Duration of the movie
- **Rating** – IMDB or other rating scores
- **Votes** – Number of votes received
- **Revenue** – Box office revenue
- **Metascore** – Score by Metacritic

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Understand the distribution of genres, ratings, and release years
- Identify trends in revenue, ratings, and popularity
- Analyze correlations between runtime, ratings, revenue, etc.
- Visualize findings with plots and charts

## 📈 Insights Gained

- Which genres are most common?
- Which years had the highest average revenue?
- Are higher-rated movies usually longer?
- What trends can we observe in movie popularity over time?
- Filter the dataset and find the best/worst *n* movies based on:
  - Highest Revenue
  - Highest Budget
  - Highest Profit (= Revenue - Budget)
  - Lowest Profit (= Revenue - Budget)
  - Highest Return on Investment (= Revenue / Budget), only for movies with Budget ≥ 10
  - Lowest Return on Investment (= Revenue / Budget), only for movies with Budget ≥ 10
  - Highest number of Votes
  - Highest Rating (only movies with 10 or more Ratings)
  - Lowest Rating (only movies with 10 or more Ratings)
  - Highest Popularity

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add predictive modeling (e.g., predicting revenue or ratings)
- Expand analysis with additional datasets (e.g., user reviews)
- Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly or Dash
